# ECON-323-Final-Project
Machine learning applied to the determinants of heart failure. The idea that social awareness leads to reduced risk of death due to heart failure using web-scraped Twitter data.

### ECON323 Final Project

This project will be in two parts:

#### 1) Data Cleaning and LASSO Regression
First, I will clean heart failure clinical records data provided by Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman.

I will then run a group LASSO regression on the data to assess the effect of anaemia, creatinine phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection fractions, high blood pressure, platelet count, serum creatinine, serum sodium, gender, smoking status, and whether death occurred following heart failure.

#### 2) Data Scraping and Data Visualization

Then, I will scrape Twitter data to examine the social awareness of heart disease and heart failure in the media. I will compare the awareness of heart disease and heart failure to the number of heart disease-related deaths that occur by month, in the year 2018, in Canada.

The purpose of this project was to focus on heart and stroke data in Canada.
